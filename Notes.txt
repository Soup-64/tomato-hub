the account the thing runs under should autologin, and the file structure is like so:
/home/autox.sh
/home/restart.sh (TODO: get it to work from ssh)
/home/FTP/files/linux-arm64/ (the actual location of the built binaries)
ensure dotnet is installed
ensure aplay is installed and audio is properly configured
